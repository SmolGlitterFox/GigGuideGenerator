Before running the app do the following steps to complete the secrets file details:
1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/
2. Create a login if you don't already have one
3. Under "My Apps" select "Add a new app"
4. Fill in the details, stating the display name as "Gig Guide Generator" or something else if it suits you - this part is unimportant
5. Once created, select "Settings"
6. Copy the AppID field and paste it into the ClientID element in the FacebookSecrets.json file
7. Show the App Secret field and copy and paste this into the ClientSecret element in the same json file
8. Copy and paste (or move) the file to your C:/ drive

And you're done! Please let me know if these instructions don't work since I have recreated them after the fact and didn't do them step by step myself to make sure all is in order.
